# Tic-Tac-Toe

# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game (Java Console Version)

A simple **two-player Tic Tac Toe game** built in **Java**, played through the **console (terminal)**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **arrays, loops, conditional logic, and user input handling** — great for beginners learning Java fundamentals.

## 🧩 Features

- 👥 **Two-player mode** — Player 1 (`X`) vs Player 2 (`O`)  
- 📋 **Dynamic 3x3 board display** after every move  
- ⚡ **Input validation** — prevents overwriting occupied cells or entering invalid positions  
- 🏆 **Winner detection** for rows, columns, and diagonals  
- 🤝 **Draw detection** when the board is full  
- 🔁 Option to **play multiple rounds**

🕹️ Gameplay Instructions

1. The game is played on a 3×3 grid.


2. Player 1 uses X, and Player 2 uses O.


3. On each turn, players enter a row and column number (0–2) to place their symbol.


4. The first player to get three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins!


5. If the board is full and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.


6. After the game, choose to play again or exit.
